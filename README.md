# Market-Trends
Documenting my analysis on market trends using several examples that may hold relevance to the current market. This will include the prediction of item prices, and the data used to predict future data will be sourced from 2017 onwards. 

We will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and use machine learning methods to understand and come up with predictions, as well as find the right build to train and test said data.
